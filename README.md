Brainfuck Notepad
=================

A fairly trivial Notepad-esque [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck) 
program which takes in a null-terminated string and produces a new (rather
inefficient) brainfuck program that prints the original string. 

You can run the program using any brainfuck interpreter, for example
[this one](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/).

Here's an example of the program in action:

Notes
-----

- Depending on your interpreter, you may or may not need to explicitly enter the
  null character at the end of your string. You don't in the one I linked.
- [This cool video](https://youtu.be/-3C200nCwpk) by TheHappieCat is what
  inspired me to start playing around with Brainfuck.
- This was the first idea I thought of that was decently interesting but still
  easy to implement.
- The two programs are functionally identical, but `notepad-commented.bf` has
  a few comments and some whitespace so that you can maybe possibly follow
  what's going on.
- It's almost 5AM and I have a test tomorrow morning. Why did I do this.
